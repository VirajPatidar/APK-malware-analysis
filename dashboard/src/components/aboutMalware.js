                            Malware, short for malicious software, is a blanket term for viruses, 
                            worms, trojans and other harmful computer programs hackers use to wreak 
                            destruction and gain access to sensitive information.
                        </div>

                        <div>
                            There are a number of different ways of categorizing malware, 
                            one of them is by how the malicious software spreads. There are 
                            three subtly different ways malware can infect target computers:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    A <span className={classes.span}>worm</span> is a standalone piece of malicious software that reproduces 
                                    itself and spreads from computer to computer.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    A <span className={classes.span}>virus</span> is a piece of computer code that inserts itself within the 
                                    code of another standalone program, then forces that program to 
                                    take malicious action and spread itself.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    A <span className={classes.span}>trojan</span> is a program that cannot reproduce itself but masquerades
                                    as something the user wants and tricks them into activating it so 
                                    it can do its damage and spread.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            Malware can also be installed on a computer "manually" by the attackers themselves, either by 
                            gaining physical access to the computer or using privilege escalation to gain remote administrator access. 
                        </div>
                        <br />
                        <div>
                            Another way to categorize malware is by what it does once it has successfully infected its victim's computers. 
                            There are a wide range of potential attack techniques used by malware:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <span className={classes.span}>Spyware</span> is defined by Webroot Cybersecurity as "malware used for the purpose of secretly gathering data on an 
                                    unsuspecting user." In essence, it spies on your behavior as you use your computer, and on the data you send 
                                    and receive, usually with the purpose of sending that information to a third party.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span className={classes.span}>A rootkit</span> is, as described by TechTarget, "a program or, more often, a collection of software tools that gives 
                                    a threat actor remote access to and control over a computer or other system."
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span className={classes.span}>Adware</span> is malware that forces your browser to redirect to web advertisements, which often themselves 
                                    seek to download further, even more malicious software.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span className={classes.span}>Ransomware</span> is a flavor of malware that encrypts your hard drive's files and demands a payment, 
                                    usually in Bitcoin, in exchange for the decryption key.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span className={classes.span}>Malvertising</span> is the use of legitimate ads or ad networks to covertly deliver malware to 
                                    unsuspecting usersâ€™ computers.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <br />
                    </Typography>

## Tech Stack
* React JS
* Material UI
* Django
* Django Rest Framework
* Androguard for static analysis
* jsPDF

<br/>

## Objectives
* Malware Detection
* Research on Android Malware
* Database Processing
* Selection of Methodology

<br/>

## Approach
* We used static analysis for the detection of malware in the APK file. Static analysis involves analysis of the package and permissions defined in the Manifest.xml file.
* Androguard is used to extract the package and permissions from the file and the extracted data is compared with a dataset which has malicious packages and permissions from over 400 malware applications.
* The result of the analysis is then printed on the screen which includes the name and size of the application, package name and the permissions and their description.
* The user is also given an option to download the result in a PDF format.
